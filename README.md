# 8-Week-SQL-Challenge

This repository contains solutions for case studies in <a href="https://8weeksqlchallenge.com">8WeekSQLChallenge</a>.
These case studies provided by Danny Ma (The creator of 8 Week SQL Challenge). Great case studies to practice SQL coding and Data Analysis 😃

Solutions are coded in **MS SQL Server**

Each case study folder contains the following:
* README.md file to explain the case study and target
* SQL file to create the tables with their respectable values
* Solution.md file with my take on the solutions for the questions in the case study
