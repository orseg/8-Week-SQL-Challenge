## Intro
Did you know that over 115 million kilograms of pizza is consumed daily worldwide??? (Well according to Wikipedia anyway‚Ä¶)

Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - ‚Äú80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!‚Äù

Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting ‚Äúrunners‚Äù to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny‚Äôs house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

## Problem Statement
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they‚Äôve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers. He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program

## Case Study Questions

    1.  What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
    2.  How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
    3.  What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
    4.  What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
    5.  Which item was the most popular for each customer?
    6.  Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
    7.  Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
    8.  What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
    9.  If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
    10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, 
        not just sushi -  how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
